    name: "Don Giovanni",
    composer: "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart",
    librettist: "Lorenzo Da Ponte",
    language: "Italian",
    year: 1787,
    summary: `Don Giovanni has had his way with Donna Anna, entering her bedroom, when she mistook him for her betrothed, Don Ottavio. Leporello,
    outside, complains of his life as a servant. Donna Anna pursues Don Giovanni and is joined by her father, who dies as they fight. Don Ottavio
    joins her in vowing revenge against the unknown assailant, while Don Giovanni and Leporello make their escape. Now they come across another woman,
    Donna Elvira, an earlier victim of Don Giovanni, who runs off, when they recognise each other, while Leporello reads her a catalogue of his master’s
    conquests. Master and servant next come across a group of peasants, ready to celebrate the marriage of Zerlina and Masetto. Don Giovanni manages to
    be left alone with Zerlina, having invited the whole company to his palace nearby, but as they go off together Donna Elvira appears, intervening to
    warn the girl. Donna Anna and Don Ottavio join them, recognising Don Giovanni by his voice. In Don Giovanni’s garden Masetto reproaches Zerlina,
    frustrating Don Giovanni’s attempts to lure her away. Donna Anna, Donna Elvira and Don Ottavio appear, masked, and are invited by Leporello to join
    the celebration. At the ball in the palace Don Giovanni takes Zerlina into another room and when she screams pretends that Leporello is guilty.
    The three masked visitors reveal themselves and accuse Don Giovanni. Outside Donna Elvira’s house, Leporello is made to impersonate his master
    to woo her, while Don Giovanni turns his attention to her maid, a cruel deception. Masetto, seeking Don Giovanni, has his helpers sent off in
    various directions by Don Giovanni, in the guise of Leporello, and when Masetto is alone he sets upon him, leaving him to be consoled by Zerlina.
    Leporello, taking refuge in the courtyard of the house of Donna Anna, is seized, but pleads for mercy, when they realise who he is. Don Giovanni
    and Leporello now come together, as night draws on, in a churchyard, where the stone statue on the tomb of the Commendatore is heard to speak.
    At this Don Giovanni tells Leporello to invite the statue to dinner. The statue accepts and in a final scene is heard slowly approaching the room
    where Don Giovanni is at dinner, to the terror first of Donna Elvira, who has been urging reform on her betrayer, and then of Leporello. The statue
    slowly enters and holding fast Don Giovanni’s hand takes him into the fiery pit that now opens before them. There follows a brief epilogue in which
    the moral of the tale is pointed by those who remain.`

    composer: "Richard Wagner",
    librettist: "Richard Wagner",
    language: "German",
    year: 1876,
    summary: `On the rock of Brünnhilde the three Norns, daughters of the Goddess of Fate, weave fate, singing of the holy ash tree,
    from which a brave god made a spear, broken by a young hero and chopped into logs at the command of Wotan, to be piled around Valhalla,
    where they will burn the place and bring an end to the gods. As dawn breaks Siegfried emerges from the cave with Brünnhilde,
    having acquired from her her strength as a Valkyrie. As he prepares to leave, he gives her his ring, a symbol of his deeds,
    and she gives him Grane, her horse. The first act opens in the Gibichung throne-room, where Hagen urges his half-brother Gunther to marry Brünnhilde,
    although she is fated to be the wife of Siegfried the Volsung, who could, by trickery, be induced to marry their sister, Gutrune. Siegfried arrives
    and swears friendship with Hagen. Drugged by Gutrune, he offers her marriage and then agrees, using the Tarncap which will transform him,
    to bring Gunther the woman he wants, in exchange for Gutrune. They swear friendship and join together ritually as blood brothers.
    Siegfried and Gunther leave, in search of Brünnhilde, while Hagen guards the house, awaiting their return, with the ring.
    Waltraute brings Brünnhilde news of Wotan’s despair, in the absence of the ring, but she refuses to part with Siegfried’s pledge of love.
    Siegfried, in the form of Gunther, leaps through the surrounding flames to claim Brünnhilde as his wife, seizing the ring from her finger.
    At the hall of the Gibichungs Alberich reminds Hagen of Siegfried’s defeat of Wotan and of the power that the ring will give them.
    Siegfried returns to claim Gutrune and Hagen calls his men to attend the coming wedding. Gunther and Brünnhilde arrive and the latter,
    seeing the ring on Siegfried’s finger, realises that there has been trickery. She curses Siegfried and tells Hagen that the hero can be
    wounded only from the back, a death that can be arranged at a hunting-party. The Rhinemaidens ask Siegfried for the ring and as the hunters rest,
    Hagen gives Siegfried a drink that revives his memory, piercing his back with his spear and mortally wounding him. Siegfried’s body is brought back,
    to Gutrune’s distress. Gunther and Hagen fight and the former is killed, but the ring cannot be taken from Siegfried’s body.
    Brünnhilde orders a pyre to be raised. This is lit, and she rides into it on her horse, Grane, wearing the ring, which will return, on her death,
    to the Rhinemaidens, who drag Hagen down to the depths of the river. Now flames are seen as Valhalla, the home of the gods, finally burns.`

    summary: `In an attic apartment in the Latin Quarter of Paris, a group of young artists are living together in poverty. Their neighbour, the
    little seamstress Mimì, introduces herself, seeking a light for her candle, when Rodolfo is left alone. They fall in love. At the Café Momus
    Rodolfo presents Mimì to his friends, while the singer Musetta abandons her elderly rich lover Alcindoro in order to join Marcello. Alcindoro
    is left to settle the bill for all of them. Time has passed. Mimì has been living with Rodolfo, but they quarrel, because of his apparent
    jealousy. He has planned to leave her, as we learn in a scene set on a cold winter morning by the city gates. Musetta, a contrast in character
    to the gentle Mimì, later returns to the attic apartment of the four young men, bringing with her the dying Mimì, whom they now try to comfort,
    but in vain, as she dies before their eyes of the consumption that has racked her.`

    summary: `In the church of S Andrea della Valle, the fugitive Angelotti takes refuge in a private chapel. The painter Cavaradossi returns to
    the canvas he is painting, a picture of Mary Magdalene, influenced by the features of his beloved Tosca and by a woman he has often seen in the
    church. The sacristan complains of the trouble Cavaradossi gives him. As he leaves, Angelotti emerges from hiding, explaining that he has escaped
    from imprisonment in the Castel Sant’Angelo. The voice of Tosca is heard and Angelotti hides again. Tosca is jealous of what she thinks may have
    been an assignation with another woman but agrees to meet her lover after her evening performance. The church fills for a celebration of a supposed
    victory over Napoleon, and Baron Scarpia and his agents seek for signs of Angelotti, suspicion falling on Cavaradossi as a possible accomplice.
    Scarpia succeeds now in arousing further jealousy in Tosca, who has returned, showing her a fan found in the chapel, belonging, in fact, to
    Angelotti’s sister. Scarpia orders his men to follow Tosca, when she leaves, as a victory Te Deum is sung. In Scarpia’s apartment the sound is
    heard of an entertainment being given below for Queen Caroline, dancing and a performance by Tosca. Cavaradossi has been arrested and is interrogated
    and, when Tosca comes in, tortured in the next room, to elicit information from her. She betrays Angelotti’s hiding-place at the well in the garden
    of Cavaradossi’s villa. The painter is to be shot at dawn, but can be saved if Tosca will give in to Scarpia’s demands on her. She pretends to agree
    and when he has signed a safe-conduct she kills him. In the third act, at Castel Sant’Angelo, Cavaradossi prepares for death, as dawn draws near.
    Tosca is brought in and, left alone with him, explains how there is to be a mock-execution, after which they can escape together. In the event
    Scarpia has his revenge. His orders did not countermand the execution and Cavaradossi is shot. When Tosca realises that he is dead, she leaps from
    the battlements to her own death, while Scarpia’s men draw threateningly near, having discovered their master’s body.`

    summary: `The Greek general Agamemnon has returned from the capture of Troy to be murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus,
    who now reign in his stead. Electra, barely tolerated in the palace, mourns her dead father, dreaming of revenge. Her younger sister Chrysothemis
    warns her that Clytemnestra plans to have her imprisoned. Clytemnestra now seeks from Electra some release from her torments, suggesting sacrifice.
    Electra agrees, and outlines the pursuit of her father’s murderers by her brother Orestes. Clytemnestra is relieved when a messenger brings news of
    the death of Orestes. Electra now tries to persuade Chrysothemis to join her in vengeance, but with no success. She digs in the ground for the axe
    she needs, to be found by Orestes, returned. He seeks out Clytemnestra and kills her. Electra is left to welcome the returning Aegisthus, dancing
    round him. He goes into the palace and is struck down. Electra dances wildly in triumph, before falling down dead, leaving Chrysothemis beating at
    the palace doors and calling the name of her brother.`

    summary: `Violetta, at a party in her house, is moved to learn that the young Alfredo Germont is in love with her. There are, however, hints already
    that she is suffering from consumption. They set up house together in the country, but Violetta secretly sells her jewels to meet the expenses they
    now incur. Alfredo learns of this from Violetta’s maid, Annina, and goes to Paris to raise money. In his absence his father arrives, seeking to
    persuade Violetta to leave Alfredo, whose behaviour prejudices the marriage chances of his sister, as well as his own prospects. Violetta sacrifices
    her own feelings and accepts an invitation from her friend Flora Bervoix which will take her back to her old life, now under the protection of Baron
    Douphol. She leaves a note for Alfredo, telling him of her decision, while old Germont tries to comfort his son, without revealing anything of Violetta’s
    true motives. Alfredo then bursts into the party at Flora’s house and insults Violetta, whom he finds with her new protector. She falls back, fainting,
    as the second act closes. In the third act Violetta is at home, near to death. Germont has told his son of the sacrifice she had made, and Alfredo now
    returns, holding her in his arms as she dies.`

    summary: `Rigoletto is happy to abet the Duke in his amorous exploits and his bitter tongue earns him the hatred of the courtiers, of Count
    Ceprano, openly cuckolded by the Duke and of Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke has dishonoured. Monterone vents his anger at the Duke
    and curses Rigoletto. Meanwhile the courtiers suspect that Rigoletto himself has a mistress and plot their revenge. The bravo Sparafucile offers
    his services to Rigoletto, should he require them, and Rigoletto sees a similarity between their functions, before he goes into his house, where
    he warns his daughter Gilda, recently returned from her convent schooling, to be careful not to leave the house. Gilda, however, has been wooed
    by one she believes to be a young student, whom she has seen in church. This is, in fact, the Duke. The courtiers take their revenge on Rigoletto
    by abducting Gilda and taking her to the Duke, assisted by a blindfold Rigoletto, who thinks he is helping the abduction of Countess Ceprano. At
    court again, he turns on those who have tricked him, and plans his own revenge on the Duke through the agency of Sparafucile. Rigoletto then seeks
    to disillusion Gilda, who still loves the Duke, by showing her the latter’s depravity. He takes her to witness an assignation with Maddalena,
    Sparafucile’s sister, having arranged that Sparafucile will murder the Duke. Maddalena, however, pleads for the life of the young man (the Duke
    disguised as a soldier), and Sparafucile agrees that if any other man should come before midnight, he will kill him in place of the Duke, and
    give Rigoletto the body in a sack, as agreed. Gilda determines to sacrifice herself for the Duke, and, dressed as a man as she is, enters the
    room and is murdered. Her body, in a sack, is delivered to Rigoletto outside, but his delight is destroyed when he hears the voice of the Duke
    inside the house, and opens the sack to reveal the body of his daughter.`

    summary: `The crowd awaits the arrival of Othello’s ship from the storm. He reaches the harbour of Cyprus triumphant, victorious in battle and is
    greeted by the people. Iago suggests to Roderigo that he may soon have Desdemona, now wife of Othello, and, through jealousy, plots against Cassio,
    whom he makes drunk. A fight breaks out with Roderigo, in which Montano becomes involved. Othello is summoned by the general alarm and dismisses Cassio
    from his service. Othello and Desdemona sing of their love, as he takes her back again into their chamber. In the second act Iago persuades Cassio to
    seek reinstatement through Desdemona and kindles and feeds Othello’s jealousy, producing as final proof of her infidelity his report of what Cassio
    has said in his sleep and the handkerchief that she has dropped and that has been taken from Emilia by Iago. In the third act Desdemona unwittingly
    fuels Othello’s anger and jealousy by continuing to plead for Cassio. Ambassadors from Venice recall Othello, with Cassio to be left in his place.
    Othello treats Desdemona cruelly, before the company, and Iago continues to play on his jealousy, the handkerchief now planted in Cassio’s lodging.
    The last act is set in Desdemona’s bedroom, where she seeks some comfort from Emilia. Woken from sleep by Othello, she again pleads her innocence,
    as he suffocates her. She can still murmur words to Emilia, when the latter brings news of Cassio’s killing of Roderigo, seeking to excuse Othello.
    Lodovico gives a report of Roderigo’s dying confession and Emilia tells of the handkerchief, convincing Othello of his tragic mistake. Seizing his
    sword, he kills himself.`

    composer: "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart",
    librettist: "Lorenzo Da Ponte",
    language: "Italian",
    year: 1786,
    summary: `Figaro and Susanna are to marry, but the Count has given them rooms near to his own, which will be convenient if he needs access to Susanna.
    Bartolo wants to take revenge on Figaro, who had helped the Count to marry his ward Rosina, now the Countess. His housekeeper Marcellina has lent money
    to Figaro, who has promised to marry her, if he cannot repay it. Cherubino tells Susanna that he loves all women, and Susanna hides him, as the Count is
    heard approaching. His proposals to Susanna are interrupted by the sound of Don Basilio coming near, and he too hides behind the chair, allowing Cherubino
    to hide himself sitting on it, under a dress thrown over him by Susanna. Basilio now refers to Cherubino’s love for the Countess, and the Count emerges to
    find out more. Susanna tries to distract them by fainting, but Cherubino is discovered. Figaro brings in a group of peasants, singing praise of the Count,
    who has surrendered, it is suggested, his droit de seigneur as far as Susanna is concerned, but the Count delays their marriage and packs Cherubino off to
    the army. Figaro, however, detains Cherubino, since he has plans for him. In the second act the Countess, in her room, is sad, neglected by her husband.
    She listens to Figaro’s plan to dress Cherubino as a girl and put him in Susanna’s place in an attempt to trap the Count. Cherubino is singing of his love
    for the Countess, when the Count returns from hunting, eager to pursue matters divulged to him in an anonymous letter accusing the Countess. Cherubino hides
    in the closet and Susanna, unseen by the others, comes in. The Countess tells her husband that Susanna is in the closet but the door cannot be opened.
    The Count, suspicious, goes to fetch tools to open the door, taking the Countess with him. This allows Cherubino to jump out of the window and Susanna to
    take his place. The Count returns and the closet is opened, revealing Susanna. Antonio, the gardener, adds complications when he comes in to complain of
    someone jumping out of the window, and Figaro now claims that it was him. The act ends with the appearance of Don Basilio, Bartolo and Marcellina, seeking
    justice. As the wedding is prepared, in the third act, Susanna, at the suggestion of the Countess, agrees to an assignation with the Count. Marcellina’s
    complaint against Figaro is heard and he claims that he needs parental consent for his marriage to her, if it is to take place. It then transpires that
    Marcellina is in fact his mother and Bartolo his father. In the fourth act, in the garden at night, Figaro is given cause for jealousy of Susanna, but
    she is now disguised as the Countess and the Countess as Susanna. The Count unknowingly woos his own wife, while Figaro deliberately provokes his jealousy
    by his own approaches to the supposed Countess, in fact Susanna. The opera ends with the Count humbled but penitent, reconciled now with his wife, Figaro
    with Susanna, Cherubino with Barbarina, and Marcellina with Bartolo.`

    summary: `Tamino tries to escape from a great serpent that is pursuing him. He faints and the Three Ladies dispose of the serpent, vying to stay behind and
    watch over him, while the others tell the Queen of what has happened. They leave and the bird-catcher Papageno makes his entrance, claiming, when Tamino comes
    to his senses, to have killed the serpent. The Ladies return and punish Papageno’s lies by putting a padlock on his mouth. They give Tamino a portrait of a
    beautiful girl, by which he is immediately fascinated. This is Pamina, abducted, he is told, by a wicked magician. The Queen of the Night makes her terrifying
    appearance, and tells Tamino that he must rescue Pamina, her daughter. The Ladies unlock Papageno’s mouth and give Tamino a magic flute and Papageno silver bells,
    protection in their quest. In Sarastro’s palace, Pamina has escaped but been caught again by Monostatos. Papageno and Monostatos confront each other, to their mutual
    terror. Papageno frees Pamina. Tamino, meanwhile, is confronted by three temples and, rebuffed at two of the temple doors, is questioned by the Speaker, an old priest
    from the Temple of Wisdom, who assures him that he will be reunited with Pamina. He plays his magic flute, to which animals emerge dancing. Papageno, captured by Monostatos,
    plays his bells, setting Monostatos and his slaves dancing and allowing their escape. The act ends with the entry of Sarastro and his priests, a prelude to the purification
    by ordeal of Tamino. The second act brings the ordeals through which Tamino, and to a limited extent Papageno, will pass. The first is of silence. Food is brought by the
    Three Boys, but Pamina’s entrance has to be greeted in silence, to her distress. The Boys later prevent her killing herself with her mother’s dagger. Tamino passes through
    the ordeals of fire and water, protected by the magic flute. Papageno has been tantalised by the occasional appearance of an old woman, claiming to be his bride. He is about
    to kill himself, when relief comes, through the Three Boys, when he makes use of the magic bells to bring a transformed young Papagena to his side. Monostatos and the Three
    Ladies, with their Queen, are still plotting against Sarastro, but are finally defeated by the power of light, with Tamino and Pamina now together in enlightenment.`

    summary: `Isolde, with her companion Brangäne, sailing on Tristan’s boat to Cornwall, rails at her fate and vows to encompass Tristan’s death, as he takes
    her from her native country to marry King Mark. Tristan had killed her betrothed, Morold, and now takes her to Cornwall as tribute, while she, haunted by
    Tristan’s gaze, had earlier cured him through her inherited magic powers of healing. Isolde summons Tristan to her, but he demurs. She now tells Brangäne
    to bring her casket of magic potions and prepares a poisoned cup for Tristan. Before they land, she calls him to her, and they both drink, but Brangäne has
    substituted for the death potion a love potion, which has immediate effect. It is now a summer night and Isolde waits for Tristan, against whom the courtier

    Kurwenal defends his master, killing Melot, and being killed in the struggle. King Mark is horrified, since he had come to unite the lovers, having learnt
    of the love potion from Brangäne. Isolde, who has swooned, wakes, only to die, as she gazes at the body of her dead lover.`

    language: "German",
    year: 1882,
    summary: `The prelude uses motifs of the Last Supper, the Holy Grail and Faith, interwoven with a sorrow motif and part of a motif associated with the torment
    of sin. Gurnemanz and four esquires, sleeping in a clearing in the woods, waken and make ready for the bath of the sick King Amfortas, balm for whose pain can
    only come from one person, a blameless fool. Kundry, who now arrives, exhausted, brings balm for the King. The mysterious nature of Kundry is discussed, the
    good fortune she brings. Gurnemanz explains the entrusting to Titurel of the Grail, the cup used at Christ’s last supper, a vessel that caught his blood, with
    the spear that caused the wound in his side. The magician Klingsor was refused admission to the temple Titurel built and in revenge created a garden with maidens
    of seductive beauty, a lure and temptation that has led to the downfall of many knights. Amfortas had been wounded attacking Klingsor’s castle and had lost to
    him the Holy Spear. Parsifal enters, having shot a swan, a deed he now regrets. He knows little of his past, except that his mother was Herzeleide, Sorrowful Heart.
    Kundry explains further that his mother had died when he deserted her. Kundry sinks to the ground, her task fulfilled. The scene changes to the temple of the Grail.
    Titurel, now too weak to officiate, asks Amfortas to display the Grail, but he refuses, since the sight of the holy vessel makes his wounds bleed the more, as a sinner.
    Eventually he carries out his allotted task and the sacred bread and wine are given to the assembled knights. Parsifal stands fascinated at what he sees, but says and
    does nothing to alleviate the suffering of Amfortas. In his castle the magician Klingsor sees in his magic glass the fool approaching. He calls up Kundry, an unwilling
    instrument of his desire to destroy Parsifal, the blameless fool, whom he now sees attacking his knights. The scene is transformed to that of a magic garden, where the
    flower maidens attempt to charm Parsifal. Kundry, now in more seductive guise, sends them away and tells Parsifal of his mother. As their lips are about to meet, Parsifal
    comes to his senses and breaks away, feeling the pain of the wound of Amfortas, which he now understands. Kundry begs him to save her from the curse under which she has
    laboured since she laughed at the crucifixion of Christ. He understands her wiles and her possible salvation, rejecting her advances. Klingsor hurls the Holy Spear at him,
    but it remains suspended above his head. He seizes it and makes the sign of the cross with it, at which the garden and castle disappear. By the third act the Kingdom of the
    Grail is in desolation, the knights living on roots and herbs. Gurnemanz finds Kundry, dishevelled and weary, as in the first act, but her face is transformed. A knight approaches,
    Parsifal, holding the Holy Spear, which he venerates. It is Good Friday and Kundry and Gurnemanz bathe and anoint Parsifal, who baptizes Kundry. The scene changes to that of the
    temple, where Amfortas will perform the ceremony of the Grail for the last time, to atone for the death of his father Titurel. Parsifal enters the temple, with Gurnemanz and Kundry,
    and heals the wound of Amfortas with the touch of the Holy Spear, which he presents to the company. It is Parsifal who now must perform the ceremony of the Grail, which he does as a
    Holy Dove appears above his head and Amfortas and Gurnemanz acknowledge their new king.`

    The mysterious knight Lohengrin appears, in a boat drawn by a swan, and, making Elsa promise never to ask his name or origin, defeats Telramund, sparing his life. Ortrud and Telramund

    summary: `Goro, the marriage-broker, shows Lieutenant Pinkerton the house where he will live with Cio-Cio-San, after their marriage, and introduces the servants. Pinkerton explains
    to the consul Sharpless, who has joined him, that he has the house on a long lease, to be terminated at a month’s notice: his coming marriage is to be undertaken on similar terms,
    since he has no intention of continuing the relationship. Cio-Cio-San and her family arrive and the wedding takes place, interrupted by the Bonze, who curses her as a renegade.
    The company disperses, leaving Cio-Cio-San and Pinkerton alone together, as evening draws on. Three years later she awaits still the return of Pinkerton, who has never seen the son
    she has borne him. Attempts are made by Goro to bring about another marriage, to Prince Yamadori. Eventually Pinkerton does return, having prepared Sharpless by a letter. He brings
    with him his American wife, and Cio-Cio-San kills herself with the knife that her father had used for his own death by imperial command.`

    language: "English",
    year: 1945,
    summary: `In the prologue, with the inquest on his apprentice, Peter Grimes is warned by the coroner, Swallow, not to take another boy apprentice. Popular prejudice against Grimes
    is strong, but Ellen Orford shows sympathy. In the first act various inhabitants of the borough appear, while the fishermen and their wives go about their daily tasks. Ned Keene has
    found Grimes another apprentice, and Hobson agrees to bring him the boy, when Ellen Orford volunteers to look after him. While hostility is general, Balstrode too offers friendly
    advice to Grimes, suggesting that he leave the town to seek work on a merchant-ship. The second scene is set in The Boar, while a storm rages outside. Mrs Sedley comes to collect the
    laudanum Keene will bring her, Balstrode jokingly complains of the noise the frightened nieces are making and Boles, drunk, makes advances to them. Grimes comes in from the storm,
    intending to collect his new apprentice. His position as an outsider increases tension that is dissolved when Auntie calls for a song. Hobson comes in, with Ellen and the boy, and
    Grimes takes the latter away at once to what he calls home. The second act opens with Sunday morning. The people are in church, while outside Ellen questions the new apprentice about
    his life. She sees the boy’s jersey is torn and that he has a bruise and pleads with Grimes to keep the day of rest, when he comes to take the boy off to work. In anger Grimes strikes
    her, the scene overheard by others, who now agree to set off in a party to Grimes’s hut to see what is going on. The men march off together, intent on dealing with Grimes. A passacaglia,
    at the centre of the opera, leads to a new scene set in Grimes’s hut. As the party of vindictive townspeople approaches, Grimes urges the boy to hurry down the cliff to the boat. The
    boy slips and falls to his death and Grimes follows down the cliff, leaving the hut empty, to the evident surprise of the men who now enter and find nothing amiss. The third act is set
    outside the Moot Hall, where a dance is taking place. Various people of the borough are seen, but Grimes is not there. Balstrode has found the jersey that Ellen had made for the boy,
    washed up on the shore. Mrs Sedley overhears and before long a band of angry men has formed, eager to hunt down Peter Grimes, the outsider. Grimes is now distraught at the disasters
    of his life and the failure of his ambitions. Balstrode advises him to take his boat out into the bay and sink it. The opera ends as Swallow confirms the coastguards’ report that a boat
    has been seen out at sea, sinking. The life of the borough resumes.`

    composer: "Benjamin Britten",
    librettist: "Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears",
    language: "English",
    year: 1960,
    summary: `In the wood at twilight the fairies and Puck set the scene for the meeting of Oberon and Tytania, quarrelling over the possession of an Indian boy. When Tytania has gone,
    Oberon tells Puck to pluck the magic herb that will help him succeed. The mortal Athenian lovers then enter, Hermia and Lysander in love and Helena hoping to win the unwilling love of
    Demetrius, who loves Hermia. Oberon tells Puck to use the magic herb on the eyes of Demetrius, so that he will love Helena. The Rustics appear, preparing their play for the Duke’s wedding.
    They are followed by a weary Lysander and Hermia. As they rest, Puck puts the magic love-herb on Lysander’s eyes. Waking, he first sees Helena, and now falls in love, following after her.
    Hermia wakes alone. Oberon approaches Tytania as she sleeps, and squeezes the magic herb on her eyes. In the second act the Rustics rehearse their play, Pyramus and Thisbe. Puck puts an
    ass’s head on Bottom and his friends scatter in fear, thinking him bewitched. Tytania wakes and falls in love with him, ordering her fairies to entertain him. Oberon endeavours to put
    matters right between Demetrius and Helena, as they sleep, and squeezes the magic herb onto the eyes of Demetrius, who now falls in love with Helena. Lysander and Demetrius quarrel, but,
    lulled to sleep, Lysander is given the remedy for his misplaced affection. The third act releases Bottom from his ass’s head and Tytania from her enchantment, while the mortal lovers are
    properly paired and Oberon has his Indian boy again. At the Duke’s palace Theseus decrees a triple wedding, for himself and the two pairs of lovers, while the wedding entertainment is to be
    Pyramus and Thisbe. At midnight the mortals disperse, leaving Oberon, Tytania and their fairies to bless the house.`

    summary: `The male and female chorus lament the state of Rome under the Etruscan upstart Tarquinius. At an army camp outside Rome Collatinus, Junius and Tarquinius drink and discuss the
    trustworthiness of women, and it seems that Lucretia alone, wife of Collatinus, is of perfect virtue. This is seen as a challenge by Tarquinius, who rides to Rome, eager to test Lucretia’s
    virtue. There he is received as a guest into her house and escorted to his chamber. As Lucretia sleeps, Tarquinius approaches and violates her chastity. The morning dawns brightly, but
    Lucretia sends now for her husband and kills herself in his presence. The male and female chorus point the Christian moral and message of hope.`

    language: "German",
    year: 1911,
    summary: `The first act opens in the bedroom of the Marschallin where the young Octavian is kneeling by the Marschallin’s bed, from which she has not yet risen. Octavian, taking advantage
    of the absence of the Field-Marshal hunting, would like to prolong the moment, but must hide as a servant brings breakfast for the Princess. They hear the sound of someone approaching,
    and Octavian hides behind a screen. Instead of the Field-Marshal, whose return they had feared, it is Baron Ochs von Lerchenau, the Marschallin’s cousin, who eventually bursts in, while
    Octavian disguises himself as a maid, but is unable to escape the attentions of the Baron. The Baron seeks the Marschallin’s help in finding a Knight of the Rose to take the traditional
    token of intended marriage to Sophie von Faninal on his behalf. She proposes her cousin Octavian, Count Rofrano, as an emissary. There follows the Marschallin’s levée, attended by various
    people who attempt to enlist her support. When they have gone, she recalls her own early marriage and realises that Octavian will soon turn his attention to a younger woman. Octavian goes,
    and the Marschallin sends after him, then despatching her page to him with the silver rose, which he will know what to do with. The second act opens in the Grand Hall of Herr von Faninal’s
    house. Sophie awaits the arrival of the Knight of the Rose and is immediately attracted to Octavian, while repelled by the boorish manners of the Baron, who follows. Sophie’s aversion and
    her feelings for Octavian lead her to refuse marriage with the Baron, who is slightly hurt in an immediate duel with Octavian. The intriguers Valzacchi and Annina, employed by the Baron but
    annoyed at his meanness, now offer their services to Octavian, who sends Annina with a note to the Baron making an assignation with Mariandel, the identity he had assumed to escape from the
    Marschallin’s bedroom. In the third act, set in an inn near Vienna, the assignation takes place, with the Baron now confronted by a series of staged apparitions, culminating in the appearance
    of Annina disguised as his abandoned wife. The Baron summons the police and matters reach a degree of complication that is solved only by the intervention of the Marschallin, who now unselfishly
    encourages the love of Sophie and Octavian.`

    composer: "Richard Strauss",
    librettist: "Hugo von Hofmannsthal",
    language: "German",
    year: 1916,
    summary: `The Prologue written for the second version of Ariadne auf Naxos is set in the house of a rich man, where preparations are being made for an evening entertainment. This is to allow the
    performance of a serious opera, a comic commedia dell’arte piece and fireworks. To save time, the patron has ordered the tragedy and comedy to be performed simultaneously. This distresses the
    composer, but his teacher, the music-master, advises compromise. The opera starts, as it should, with Ariadne lamenting her fate, to the boredom of listening nymphs. The comedians, however, now
    intervene to console her, ignored by Ariadne, even when Zerbinetta interrupts. The comedians seek Zerbinetta’s favour. The approach of the god Bacchus (Dionysus) arouses Ariadne and the two sing
    ecstatically, against a starry heaven. Zerbinetta has her own comment to make on all this in the first version, followed then by the bourgeois gentleman, Monsieur Jourdain himself. In the second
    version, now usually followed, Bacchus and Ariadne have the last word.`

    year: 1942,
    summary: `At the estate of Count Rostov, Prince Andrey Bolkonsky, a widower, realises, in the beauty of the evening and the innocent beauty of the Count’s daughter Natasha, that life still promises
    happiness. Natasha meets Prince Andrey at a ball in St Petersburg, to his happiness, but his father insists that he spend a year abroad, and the behaviour of Andrey’s father is intimidating. Natasha,
    meanwhile, is the object of affection of Prince Anatol, brother-in-law of Pierre Bezhukov, who plans to elope with her. The plot is divulged and foiled at the last minute, allowing Pierre to tell
    Natasha of his own feelings for her, were he free. The second part of the opera concerns war rather than peace, with the battle of Borodino. Pierre is an observer, but Andrey is wounded. Moscow is
    destroyed, in pursuit of the scorched earth policy that defeated Napoleon. Andrey, evacuated with the other wounded, dies in the presence of Natasha, who has found him again. Pierre has been taken
    prisoner by the French, but is rescued, as the opera draws to its patriotic close.`

    year: 1921,
    summary: `The prologue brings an argument between those who favour different forms of entertainment, overruled by what follows. The cure of laughter must be found for the Prince’s hypochondria.
    Leander, an enemy of the King, plots with Clarice, his possible successor, to make the Prince’s condition worse. Truffaldino tries to amuse him in various ways, but only succeeds by accident when
    Fata Morgana falls over, exposing herself. She curses him with the love for three oranges that he must now pursue. With the help of Celio and Farfarello the Prince finds the three oranges in the
    kitchen-garden of the witch Creonta. The oranges must only be opened in the presence of water. The first two reveal princesses, who emerge only to die of thirst. The third, Ninetta, comes out when
    the Prince himself opens the last orange, saved from death by the intervention of those watching. Ninetta demands proper clothes, before accompanying the Prince, and in his absence is changed by
    Fata Morgana into a rat, her place taken by the slave-girl Smeraldina. A happy ending is secured when Celio changes Ninetta back into her original form, with Smeraldina, Fata Morgana, Clarice and
    Leander disappearing through a trap-door.`

    summary: `At an inn the knight Ruprecht hears the cries of Renata, who tells him of the angel that visited her in childhood, her distraction by carnal pleasures and her rediscovery of the angel
    in the guise of Count Heinrich, who abandoned her. The hostess at the inn tells Ruprecht that Renata is wicked and a witch. Failing to seduce Renata, Ruprecht accompanies her in her search for
    Heinrich, for which she uses what magic resources she can. Ruprecht seeks the help of the philosopher and magician Agrippa von Nettelsheim, to no avail. Finding Heinrich, Renata at first renounces
    him, herself again rejected, and asks Ruprecht to kill him. Heinrich appears in the radiant form of the angel, and Renata now changes her mind. Ruprecht is wounded in a duel with Count Heinrich,
    but now Renata tells him she will enter a convent, trying to kill herself, when he declares again his love for her. They are observed by Faust and Mephistopheles, who promise to show Ruprecht the
    town. In the convent Renata is accused of heresy and in a final scene of pandemonium, with the nuns apparently possessed, she is condemned as a heretic.`
