    summary: `ACT I
    Spain, mid-18th century. Leporello, servant to the nobleman Don Giovanni, keeps watch outside the Commendatore’s home at night.
    Suddenly, the Commendatore’s daughter, Donna Anna, rushes out, struggling with the masked Giovanni and followed by her father.
    The Commendatore challenges Giovanni to a duel and is killed. Giovanni and Leporello escape. Anna asks her fiancé, Don Ottavio,
    to avenge her father’s death.
    In the morning, Giovanni and Leporello encounter one of Giovanni’s former conquests, Donna Elvira, who is devastated by his betrayal.
    Leporello tells her she is neither the first nor the last woman to fall victim to Giovanni and shows her his catalogue with the name
    of every woman Giovanni has seduced.
    Peasants celebrate the marriage of Masetto and Zerlina. Giovanni flirts with the bride, telling her she is destined for a better life.
    But Elvira urges Zerlina to flee her suitor. She also warns Anna, who is still unaware of the identity of her father’s murderer and
    has asked Giovanni for help in finding the man. Giovanni, for his part, insists that Elvira is mad, and Anna and Ottavio wonder what
    to believe. As Giovanni leaves, Anna suddenly recognizes his voice as that of the murderer. Devastated but determined, she once more
    asks Ottavio to avenge her. He wonders how to restore her peace of mind. Giovanni, who has invited the entire wedding party to his home,
    looks forward to an evening of drinking and dancing.
    Outside Giovanni’s home, Zerlina asks Masetto to forgive her. Giovanni enters and leads them both inside. Anna, Elvira, and Ottavio appear
    masked and are invited in by Leporello. In the ballroom, Giovanni dances with Zerlina, then tries to drag her into the adjoining room.
    When she cries for help, Giovanni blames Leporello. Anna, Elvira, and Ottavio take off their masks and, along with Zerlina and Masetto,
    accuse Giovanni, who is momentarily surprised but manages to slip away.
    ACT II
    Having exchanged clothes with Giovanni, Leporello takes Elvira on a nighttime walk, leaving his master free to serenade her maid.
    When Masetto arrives with a band of peasants to hunt down Giovanni, the disguised Don sends them off in various directions, then beats
    up Masetto. Zerlina finds her bruised fiancé and comforts him.
    Later that night, Leporello—still believed by Elvira to be Giovanni—is surprised by Anna, Ottavio, Zerlina, and Masetto, who all
    denounce the supposed Don. Fearing for his life, Leporello reveals his true identity before making his escape. Ottavio proclaims that
    he will take revenge on Giovanni and asks the others to look after Anna. Elvira thinks about Giovanni, whom she still loves in spite
    of everything.
    In a cemetery, Giovanni and Leporello meet the statue of the Commendatore, who warns Giovanni that by morning he will laugh no longer.
    Giovanni forces the terrified Leporello to invite the statue to dinner. The statue accepts.
    Once again, Ottavio asks Anna to marry him, but she replies that she will not until her father’s death has been avenged.
    Elvira arrives at Giovanni’s home. She makes a last desperate attempt to persuade him to change his life, but he only laughs at her.
    The figure of the Commendatore enters and asks Giovanni to repent. When he boldly refuses he is consumed by flames. Elvira, Anna,
    Ottavio, Zerlina, Masetto, and Leporello appear, contemplating their futures and the fate of an immoral man.`

    summary: `On the rock of Brünnhilde the three Norns, daughters of the Goddess of Fate, weave fate, singing of the holy ash tree, from which a brave god made a spear, broken by a young hero and chopped into logs at the command of Wotan, to be piled around Valhalla, where they will burn the place and bring an end to the gods. As dawn breaks Siegfried emerges from the cave with Brünnhilde, having acquired from her her strength as a Valkyrie. As he prepares to leave, he gives her his ring, a symbol of his deeds, and she gives him Grane, her horse. The first act opens in the Gibichung throne-room, where Hagen urges his half-brother Gunther to marry Brünnhilde, although she is fated to be the wife of Siegfried the Volsung, who could, by trickery, be induced to marry their sister, Gutrune. Siegfried arrives and swears friendship with Hagen. Drugged by Gutrune, he offers her marriage and then agrees, using the Tarncap which will transform him, to bring Gunther the woman he wants, in exchange for Gutrune. They swear friendship and join together ritually as blood brothers. Siegfried and Gunther leave, in search of Brünnhilde, while Hagen guards the house, awaiting their return, with the ring. Waltraute brings Brünnhilde news of Wotan’s despair, in the absence of the ring, but she refuses to part with Siegfried’s pledge of love. Siegfried, in the form of Gunther, leaps through the surrounding flames to claim Brünnhilde as his wife, seizing the ring from her finger. At the hall of the Gibichungs Alberich reminds Hagen of Siegfried’s defeat of Wotan and of the power that the ring will give them. Siegfried returns to claim Gutrune and Hagen calls his men to attend the coming wedding. Gunther and Brünnhilde arrive and the latter, seeing the ring on Siegfried’s finger, realises that there has been trickery. She curses Siegfried and tells Hagen that the hero can be wounded only from the back, a death that can be arranged at a hunting-party. The Rhinemaidens ask Siegfried for the ring and as the hunters rest, Hagen gives Siegfried a drink that revives his memory, piercing his back with his spear and mortally wounding him. Siegfried’s body is brought back, to Gutrune’s distress. Gunther and Hagen fight and the former is killed, but the ring cannot be taken from Siegfried’s body. Brünnhilde orders a pyre to be raised. This is lit, and she rides into it on her horse, Grane, wearing the ring, which will return, on her death, to the Rhinemaidens, who drag Hagen down to the depths of the river. Now flames are seen as Valhalla, the home of the gods, finally burns.`

    name: "La bohème",
    composer: "Giacomo Puccini",
    language: "Italian",
    year: 1896,
    summary: "La Bohème is one of the three operas - the others are Carmen and Aida - believed to be the most popular ever written. In the case of La Bohème the reason is that it virtually defines the term 'romantic'. The poignant story of Mimì and Rodolfo is told in music of such tender beauty, allied, as always, to Puccini's intuition of what works in the theatre, resulting in an opera that readily appeals to our emotions and senses. 'Che gelida manina - Your tiny hand is frozen...' The moment when Mimì and Rodolfo meet and first touch is one of the very great moments of opera - created by the master hand of Giacomo Puccini, who unerringly trod the fine line between romance and sentimentality. Thomson Smillie outlines the background to the opera, explaining how painstakingly the composer worked to achieve this effect. An absorbing introduction both for those approaching La Bohème for the first time and for those wanting to know a bit more than just the big arias."

    year: 1900,
    summary: "Tosca is Puccini at the peak of his theatrical power. The story of the jealous, impassioned opera singer Floria Tosca and her doomed love for the painter Mario Cavaradossi is played out against backgrounds both historically and geographically overwhelming. It is set in three great and historical locations of Rome during the Napoleonic era. Spectacle, sensuality and cruelty battle for our attention in one of the most truly 'action-packed' works of theatre. Enticing us with just a couple of the 'great tunes' from this deeply affecting opera, David Timson then begins setting the biographical and operatic scene. The enduring popularity of Tosca is quickly understood - its appeal generated largely from exactly the same elements which once caused academics to brand it a 'shabby little shocker'. The master of melody is at his finest, as David Timson illustrates with characteristic enthusiasm."

    summary: `ACT I
    Violetta Valéry knows that she will die soon, exhausted by her restless life as a courtesan. At a party she is introduced to Alfredo Germont, who has been fascinated by her for a long time. Rumor has it that he has been enquiring after her health every day. The guests are amused by this seemingly naïve and emotional attitude, and they ask Alfredo to propose a toast. He celebrates true love, and Violetta responds in praise of free love (Ensemble: “Libiamo ne’ lieti calici”). She is touched by his candid manner and honesty. Suddenly she feels faint, and the guests withdraw. Only Alfredo remains behind and declares his love (Duet: “Un dì felice”). There is no place for such feelings in her life, Violetta replies. But she gives him a camellia, asking him to return when the flower has faded. He realizes this means he will see her again the following day. Alone, Violetta is torn by conflicting emotions—she doesn’t want to give up her way of life, but at the same time she feels that Alfredo has awakened her desire to be truly loved (“Ah, fors’è lui… Sempre libera”).
    ACT II
    Violetta has chosen a life with Alfredo, and they enjoy their love in the country, far from society (“De’ miei bollenti spiriti”). When Alfredo discovers that this is only possible because Violetta has been selling her property, he immediately leaves for Paris to procure money. Violetta has received an invitation to a masked ball, but she no longer cares for such distractions. In Alfredo’s absence, his father, Giorgio Germont, pays her a visit. He demands that she separate from his son, as their relationship threatens his daughter’s impending marriage (Duet: “Pura siccome un angelo”). But over the course of their conversation, Germont comes to realize that Violetta is not after his son’s money—she is a woman who loves unselfishly. He appeals to Violetta’s generosity of spirit and explains that, from a bourgeois point of view, her liaison with Alfredo has no future. Violetta’s resistance dwindles and she finally agrees to leave Alfredo forever. Only after her death shall he learn the truth about why she returned to her old life. She accepts the invitation to the ball and writes a goodbye letter to her lover. Alfredo returns, and while he is reading the letter, his father appears to console him (“Di Provenza”). But all the memories of home and a happy family can’t prevent the furious and jealous Alfredo from seeking revenge for Violetta’s apparent betrayal.
    At the masked ball, news has spread of Violetta and Alfredo’s separation. There are grotesque dance entertainments, ridiculing the duped lover. Meanwhile, Violetta and her new lover, Baron Douphol, have arrived. Alfredo and the baron battle at the gaming table and Alfredo wins a fortune: lucky at cards, unlucky in love. When everybody has withdrawn, Alfredo confronts Violetta, who claims to be truly in love with the Baron. In his rage Alfredo calls the guests as witnesses and declares that he doesn’t owe Violetta anything. He throws his winnings at her. Giorgio Germont, who has witnessed the scene, rebukes his son for his behavior. The baron challenges his rival to a duel.
    ACT III
    Violetta is dying. Her last remaining friend, Doctor Grenvil, knows that she has only a few more hours to live. Alfredo’s father has written to Violetta, informing her that his son was not injured in the duel. Full of remorse, he has told him about Violetta’s sacrifice. Alfredo wants to rejoin her as soon as possible. Violetta is afraid that he might be too late (“Addio, del passato”). The sound of rampant celebrations are heard from outside while Violetta is in mortal agony. But Alfredo does arrive and the reunion fills Violetta with a final euphoria (Duet: “Parigi, o cara”). Her energy and exuberant joy of life return. All sorrow and suffering seems to have left her—a final illusion, before death claims her.`

    summary: `ACT I

    As a tempest rages in the harbor of Cyprus,
    citizens await the return of their governor,
    Otello, a Moorish general in the Venetian
    army. When his ship is sighted, the Cypriots
    call on heaven to spare it.
    Safely in port, Otello proclaims victory
    over the Turks ("Esultate!") Otello then
    enters his castle. His ensign, Iago, angered
    because a rival,Cassio, has been promoted
    to captain, plots his own advancement by
    fanning the secret desires of Roderigo, a
    Venetian dandy, for Otello's wife, Desdemona.
    Meanwhile, the Cypriots gather around a
    bonfire. Iago, leading a drinking song
    (brindisi: "Inaffia l'ugola,") forces the easily
    intoxicated Cassio to drink a toast to Otello
    and his bride; the ensign next provokes
    Roderigo to duel with the reeling Cassio.
    Otello, awakened by the brawl, storms
    out to demand an explanation; Iago pretends
    ignorance. As Desdemona joins her husband,
    he demotes Cassio, instructing Iago to restore
    order. Otello and Desdemona, left alone,
    tenderly recall their courtship ("Gi… nella
    notte densa ") and kiss three times before
    re-entering the castle.

    ACT II

    By the castle garden, Iago advises Cassio to
    seek Desdemona's aid in regaining Otello's
    favor. Cassio goes off, leaving Iago to
    describe his view of his creator, a cruel
    demon who gives him ideas for evil
    machinations ("Credo.")
    On Otello's arrival, the ensign makes
    innuendos about Desdemona's fidelity as
    they see her in the garden with Emilia (Iago's
    wife) and Cassio; yet he warns the Moor to
    beware of jealousy. Women, children and
    sailors bring flowers to Desdemona, whose
    beauty softens Otello's suspicions, but when
    she approaches him about Cassio's
    reinstatement, he grows irritable. Fearing he
    is ill, she tries to soothe his brow with a
    handkerchief, which he throws to the ground.
    Desdemona, confused, pleads her devotion,
    while Iago furtively wrenches the
    handkerchief from Emilia, who has retrieved
    it.
    When the women leave, Otello accuses
    his ensign of destroying his peace of mind.
    Iago answers the Moor's demand for proof by
    pretending he has heard Cassio murmur
    Desdemona's name in his sleep ("Era la
    notte"); worse he says he saw in Cassio's
    hand the strawberry-embroidered
    handkerchief Otello gave her when he first
    courted her. Seconded by Iago, Otello vows
    vengeance ("Si, pel ciel.")

    ACT III

    In the armory, Iago tells Otello that more proof
    is forthcoming and then departs as
    Desdemona greets her husband ("Dio ti
    giocondi.") The Moor hints at his suspicions
    but she fails to understand. When he
    demands the handkerchief he once gave her,
    she again pleads for Cassio, driving Otello to
    call her a courtesan. Tearfully, Desdemona
    swears her innocence; the Moor sends her
    away.
    Spent with rage, Otello wishes heaven
    had taxed him with any affliction but this ("
    Dio! mi potevi scagliar,") then hides at the
    approach of Cassio and Iago. The ensign,
    flashing the handkerchief, manipulates
    Cassio's banter about his mistress, Bianca, so
    that Otello thinks they are joking about
    Desdemona. Cassio leaves as trumpets
    announce dignitaries from Venice. Otello
    swears to kill his wife.
    In the great hall, the court enters to
    welcome Lodovico, the ambassador, who
    presents papers recalling Otello to Venice
    and naming Cassio governor. Otello loses
    self-control and hurls Desdemona to the floor.
    She begs forgiveness for her supposed
    crime. The courtiers try to console her, but
    Otello orders them out. As the Moor falls
    unconscious in a fit, Iago ironically salutes
    him as the "Lion of Venice."

    ACT IV

    In her room, as Emilia helps her prepare for
    bed, Desdemona sings a song about a maid,
    Barbara, who was forsaken by her lover
    (willow song: "Salce! Salce!") Startled by
    the wind she bids her companion goodnight,
    says her prayers ("Ave Maria ") and retires.
    Otello steals in and tenderly kisses
    Desdemona. When she awakens, he tells her
    to prepare for death; though she protests her
    innocence, he strangles her.
    Emilia knocks with news that Cassio has
    slain Roderigo. Hearing Desdemona's death
    moan, she cries for help, bringing Iago,
    Lodovico and Cassio. When Emilia tells of
    Iago's treachery, he stabs his wife and rushes
    from the room.`

    summary: `ACT I
    A manor house near Seville, the 1930s. In a storeroom that they have been allocated, Figaro and Susanna, servants to the Count and Countess Almaviva, are preparing for their wedding. Figaro is furious when he learns from his bride that the Count has tried to seduce her. He’s determined to have revenge on his master. Dr. Bartolo appears with his former housekeeper, Marcellina, who is equally determined to marry Figaro. She has a contract: Figaro must marry her or repay the money he borrowed from her. When Marcellina runs into Susanna, the two rivals exchange insults. Susanna returns to her room, and the Count’s young page Cherubino rushes in. Finding Susanna alone, he speaks of his love for all the women in the house, particularly the Countess. When the Count appears, again trying to seduce Susanna, Cherubino hides. The Count then conceals himself when Basilio, the music teacher, approaches. Basilio tells Susanna that everyone knows Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Outraged, the Count steps forward, but he becomes even more enraged when he discovers Cherubino and realizes that the boy has overheard his attempts to seduce Susanna. He chases Cherubino into the great hall, encountering Figaro, who has assembled the entire household to sing the praises of their master. Put on the spot, the Count is forced to bless the marriage of Figaro and Susanna. To spite them and to silence Cherubino, he orders the boy to join the army without delay. Figaro sarcastically sends Cherubino off into battle.
    ACT II
    In her bedroom, Rosina, the Countess, mourns the loss of love in her life. Encouraged by Figaro and Susanna, she agrees to set a trap for her husband: They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a rendezvous with the Count that night. At the same time, Figaro will send the Count an anonymous note suggesting that the Countess is having an assignation with another man. Cherubino arrives, and the two women lock the door before dressing him in women’s clothes. When Susanna steps into an adjoining room, the Count knocks and is annoyed to find the door locked. Cherubino hides himself in the dressing room, and the Countess lets her husband in. When there’s a sudden noise from behind the door, the Count is skeptical of his wife’s story that Susanna is in there. Taking his wife with him, he leaves to get tools to force the door. Meanwhile, Susanna, who has reentered the room unseen and observed everything, helps Cherubino escape through the window before taking his place in the dressing room. When the Count and Countess return, both are astonished when Susanna emerges from the room. Figaro arrives to begin the wedding festivities, but the Count questions him about the note he received. Figaro successfully eludes questioning until the gardener, Antonio, bursts in, complaining that someone has jumped from the window. Figaro improvises quickly, feigning a limp and pretending that it was he who jumped. As soon as Antonio leaves, Bartolo, Marcellina, and Basilio appear, putting their case to the Count and holding the contract that obliges Figaro to marry Marcellina. Delighted, the Count declares that Figaro must honor his agreement and that his wedding to Susanna will be postponed.
    ACT III
    Later that day in the great hall, Susanna leads on the Count with promises of a rendezvous that night. He is overjoyed but then overhears Susanna conspiring with Figaro. In a rage, he declares that he will have revenge. The Countess, alone, recalls her past happiness. Marcellina, accompanied by a lawyer, Don Curzio, demands that Figaro pay his debt or marry her at once. Figaro replies that he can’t marry without the consent of his parents for whom he’s been searching for years, having been abducted as a baby. When he reveals a birthmark on his arm, Marcellina realizes that he is her long-lost son, fathered by Bartolo. Arriving to see Figaro and Marcellina embracing, Susanna thinks her fiancé has betrayed her, but she is pacified when she learns the truth. The Countess is determined to go through with the conspiracy against her husband, and she and Susanna compose a letter to him confirming the meeting with Susanna that evening in the garden. Cherubino, now dressed as a girl, appears with his sweetheart, Barbarina, the daughter of Antonio. Antonio, who has found Cherubino’s cap, also arrives and reveals the young man. The Count is furious to discover that Cherubino has disobeyed him and is still in the house. Barbarina punctures his anger, explaining that the Count, when he attempted to seduce her, promised her anything she desired. Now, she wants to marry Cherubino, and the Count reluctantly agrees. The household assembles for Figaro and Susanna’s wedding. While dancing with the Count, Susanna hands him the note, sealed with a pin, confirming their tryst that evening.
    ACT IV
    At night in the garden, Barbarina despairs that she has lost the pin the Count has asked her to take back to Susanna as a sign that he’s received her letter. When Figaro and Marcellina appear, Barbarina tells them about the planned rendezvous between the Count and Susanna. Thinking that his bride is unfaithful, Figaro curses all women. He hides when Susanna and the Countess arrive, dressed in each other’s clothes. Alone, Susanna sings of love. She knows that Figaro is listening and enjoys making him think that she’s about to betray him with the Count. She then conceals herself—in time to see Cherubino try to seduce the disguised Countess. When the Count arrives looking for Susanna, he chases the boy away. Figaro, by now realizing what is going on, joins in the joke and declares his passion for Susanna in her Countess disguise. The Count returns to discover Figaro with his wife, or so he thinks, and explodes with rage. At that moment, the real Countess steps forward and reveals her identity. Ashamed, the Count asks her pardon. Ultimately, she forgives him, and the entire household celebrates the day’s happy ending.`

    summary: `A mythical land between the sun and the moon. Three ladies in the service of the Queen of the Night save Prince Tamino from a serpent. When they leave to tell the queen, the birdcatcher Papageno appears. He boasts to Tamino that it was he who killed the creature. The ladies return to give Tamino a portrait of the queen’s daughter, Pamina, who they say has been enslaved by the evil Sarastro. Tamino immediately falls in love with the girl’s picture. The queen, appearing in a burst of thunder, tells Tamino about the loss of her daughter and commands him to rescue her. The ladies give a magic flute to Tamino and silver bells to Papageno to ensure their safety on the journey and appoint three spirits to guide them.
    Sarastro’s slave Monostatos pursues Pamina but is frightened away by Papageno. The birdcatcher tells Pamina that Tamino loves her and is on his way to save her. Led by the three spirits to the temple of Sarastro, Tamino learns from a high priest that it is the Queen, not Sarastro, who is evil. Hearing that Pamina is safe, Tamino charms the wild animals with his flute, then rushes off to follow the sound of Papageno’s pipes. Monostatos and his men chase Papageno and Pamina but are left helpless when Papageno plays his magic bells. Sarastro enters in great ceremony. He punishes Monostatos and promises Pamina that he will eventually set her free. Pamina catches a glimpse of Tamino, who is led into the temple with Papageno.
    Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino will undergo initiation rites. Monostatos tries to kiss the sleeping Pamina but is surprised by the appearance of the Queen of the Night. The Queen gives her daughter a dagger and orders her to murder Sarastro.
    Sarastro finds the desperate Pamina and consoles her, explaining that he is not interested in vengeance. Tamino and Papageno are told by a priest that they must remain silent and are not allowed to eat, a vow that Papageno immediately breaks when he takes a glass of water from a flirtatious old lady. When he asks her name, the old lady vanishes. The three spirits appear to guide Tamino through the rest of his journey and to tell Papageno to be quiet. Tamino remains silent even when Pamina appears. Misunderstanding his vow for coldness, she is heartbroken.
    The priests inform Tamino that he has only two more trials to complete his initiation. Papageno, who has given up on entering the brotherhood, longs for a wife instead. He eventually settles for the old lady. When he promises to be faithful she turns into a beautiful young Papagena but immediately disappears.
    Pamina and Tamino are reunited and face the ordeals of water and fire together, protected by the magic flute.
    Papageno tries to hang himself on a tree but is saved by the three spirits, who remind him that if he uses his magic bells he will find true happiness. When he plays the bells, Papagena appears and the two start making family plans. The Queen of the Night, her three ladies, and Monostatos attack the temple but are defeated and banished. Sarastro blesses Pamina and Tamino as all join in hailing the triumph of courage, virtue, and wisdom.`

    summary: "Madama Butterfly runs the gamut of operatic emotions. The title heroine has a fragility wonderfully expressed in her entry music, deep sexual instincts as shown in the love duet, and immense tragic stature in her last hours. The fate of Madama Butterfly - married to an American sailor and then abandoned - engages our emotions, as it obviously did Puccini's to a degree equalled by few other opera heroines. The oriental setting and the exquisite orchestral and choral writings are treasured bonuses. This audiobook is the perfect introduction to Madama Butterfly. We learn about the background to Puccini's 'Japanese' opera, the social themes of honour and loyalty it involves, and how it progressed from a surprisingly unsuccessful premiere to one of the central and best-loved works of the international operatic repertory. As the story unfolds, we get to know the melodies which make this such a moving and compelling opera."

When he asks the Marschallin for advice as to which cavalier could present Sophie with the traditional silver engagement rose, she suggests Octavian—who suddenly, to avoid discovery, emerges from his hiding place disguised as a chambermaid. The baron instantly starts to make advances towards “Mariandel,” who quickly makes her escape as the room fills with the daily crowd of petitioners and salespeople. Among them is a singer, whose aria is cut short by Ochs’s wrangling with a lawyer over Sophie’s dowry. The Baron hires a pair of Italian intriguers, Annina and Valzacchi, to locate the shy servant girl.
    When the room is cleared, the Marschallin, appalled by the thought of the rude Ochs marrying the innocent young girl, muses on her own waning youth. The returning Octavian is surprised to find her in a distant and melancholy mood. He passionately declares his love but she can only think about the passing of time and tells him that one day he will leave her for a younger woman. Hurt, he rushes off. The Marschallin tries to call him back, but it is too late. She summons her page and sends Octavian the silver rose.
    ACT II
    On the morning of her engagement, Sophie excitedly awaits the arrival of the cavalier of the rose. Octavian enters and presents her with the silver rose on behalf of the Baron. Sophie accepts, enraptured, and the two young people feel an instant attraction to each other. When Ochs, whom Sophie has never met, arrives, the girl is shocked by his crude manners. Ochs goes off to discuss the wedding contract with Faninal, and Sophie asks Octavian for help. They end up embracing and are surprised by Annina and Valzacchi, who summon Ochs. The outraged Octavian grazes the Baron’s arm with his rapier and Ochs melodramatically calls for a doctor. In the ensuing confusion, Sophie tells her father that she will not marry the Baron, while Octavian enlists Annina and Valzacchi to participate in an intrigue he is hatching. When Ochs is alone, nursing his wound with a glass of wine, Annina, sent by Octavian, appears with a letter from “Mariandel,” asking Ochs to a rendezvous. Intoxicated with his own charm, the Baron is delighted at the prospect of a tête-à-tête. When he refuses to tip Annina, she determines to get even.
    ACT III
    At Octavian’s instigation, Annina and Valzacchi prepare the back room of a dingy inn for Ochs’s rendezvous. Before long, the Baron and “Mariandel” arrive for a private supper. As she coyly leads him on, grotesque apparitions pop out of windows and secret panels, terrifying the Baron. Annina, disguised as a widow, runs in crying that Ochs is the father of her many children. When the police appear, Ochs claims that “Mariandel” is his fiancée. The arriving Faninal, furious at his future son-in-law’s behavior, summons Sophie to set matters straight, then faints and is carried off. At the height of the confusion, the Marschallin enters. Octavian takes off his disguise and the Marschallin explains to Ochs that it was all a farce. He finally admits defeat and leaves, pursued by the innkeeper and various other people who all demand payment of their bills. Left alone with Octavian and Sophie, the Marschallin laments that she must lose her lover so soon, but nevertheless accepts the truth. She gives the bewildered Octavian to Sophie and quietly leaves the room. The young lovers realize that their dream has come true.`

    id: 20,
    name: "Ariadne auf Naxos",
    composer: "Richard Strauss",
    language: "German",
    year: 1915,
    summary: `PROLOGUE

    Musicians, singers, actors, carpenters, and stage
    hands are preparing for the first performance of a
    serious opera which has been specially
    commissioned by the owner of the house to
    entertain his guests.
    There is consternation when the Major-domo
    announces that, after the opera, there will be a
    Harlequinade entertainment; moreover the two
    shows must not overrun their allotted span of
    time,as the fireworks will begin precisely at nine o
    clock! Worse is to come, as a little later the
    Major-domo returns to inform the two troupes that
    his master has changed his mind: now both
    entertainments will be played simultaneously, the
    serious opera being punctuated by intervals of
    dancing from the comedians.
    The composer of the serious opera
    extemporizes an aria which he intends for the
    tenor and languishes at the idea of his
    masterpiece being combined with a common
    dancing show. He tries to explain to Zerbinetta
    that Ariadne prefers death to the embraces of any
    man other that her beloved, and proving
    unsuccessful in this, he indulges in a duet with
    Zerbinetta in which he comes perilously close to
    declaring that he loves her. There is some trouble
    with both tenor and prima donna, after which the
    composer declares his conviction in the power of
    music, the most sacred of the arts.



    THE OPERA

    After an interval, the curtain rises on the opera
    itself, watched from boxes by the owner of the
    house and his guests. The setting, which is seen
    only from its reversed side in the Prologue, is now
    seen from the front. At one side is a cave in whose
    entrance Ariadne can be seen asleep, watched by
    Naiad, Dryad and Echo. These creatures express
    a certain sympathy with Ariadne's sorrow, to
    which, however, they have become accustomed
    with the passage of time.
    Ariadne speaks as if in a dream. She takes no
    notice when the Harlequinade quartet and
    Zerbinetta comment on her distress and try to
    think of a means to comfort her. Ariadne
    welcomes the idea of death. Not even a
    determined effort by Harlequin to cure her of her
    madness - for he thinks it must surely be that
    which is wrong with her - can stop her for long.
    Ariadne continues and, at mention of death's
    messenger, Hermes, she becomes more urgent.



    The four comedians make another attempt to
    cheer up the melancholy Ariadne, but their
    dancing and singing have not the slightest effect,
    even when they are joined by the sprightly
    Zerbinetta. Eventually, Zerbinetta bids them leave
    her to see what she can do on her own.
    Zerbinetta appeals to Ariadne, woman to
    woman. Ariadne is not the first to be abandoned
    by her lover, and will not be the last. Zerbinetta
    expounds her own fickle philosophy, and is quite
    unconcerned when Ariadne disappears inside her
    cave. Zerbinetta goes into details of her amorous
    career: she is pursued by the four comedians,
    each of whom seems amorously inclined.
    Zerbinetta encourages and eludes them all, until
    only Scaramuccio, Brighella, and Truffaldino are
    left. Much to their annoyance, Zerbinetta is
    immediately heard conversing tenderly with the
    Harlequin, whom they had thought safely out of
    the way. They rush to see what they can do about
    it.
    No sooner are they gone than the three
    attendant nymphs return to the stage, full of the
    sight they have just seen. A youthful god is
    coming, Bacchus, fresh from the embraces of
    Circe, but eager for a new adventure. They call to
    Ariadne, who emerges from the cave in time to
    hear Bacchus calling for Circe. The nymphs beg
    him to continue singing, and Ariadne hails him as
    the longed for messenger of death. In the arms of
    Bacchus, Ariadne finds consolation and
    Zerbinetta pops in to comment that all has turned
    out exactly as she would have expected.`
