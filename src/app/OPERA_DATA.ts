    summary: `ACT I
    Spain, mid-18th century. Leporello, servant to the nobleman Don Giovanni, keeps watch outside the Commendatore’s home at night.
    Suddenly, the Commendatore’s daughter, Donna Anna, rushes out, struggling with the masked Giovanni and followed by her father.
    The Commendatore challenges Giovanni to a duel and is killed. Giovanni and Leporello escape. Anna asks her fiancé, Don Ottavio,
    to avenge her father’s death.
    In the morning, Giovanni and Leporello encounter one of Giovanni’s former conquests, Donna Elvira, who is devastated by his betrayal.
    Leporello tells her she is neither the first nor the last woman to fall victim to Giovanni and shows her his catalogue with the name
    of every woman Giovanni has seduced.
    Peasants celebrate the marriage of Masetto and Zerlina. Giovanni flirts with the bride, telling her she is destined for a better life.
    But Elvira urges Zerlina to flee her suitor. She also warns Anna, who is still unaware of the identity of her father’s murderer and
    has asked Giovanni for help in finding the man. Giovanni, for his part, insists that Elvira is mad, and Anna and Ottavio wonder what
    to believe. As Giovanni leaves, Anna suddenly recognizes his voice as that of the murderer. Devastated but determined, she once more
    asks Ottavio to avenge her. He wonders how to restore her peace of mind. Giovanni, who has invited the entire wedding party to his home,
    looks forward to an evening of drinking and dancing.
    Outside Giovanni’s home, Zerlina asks Masetto to forgive her. Giovanni enters and leads them both inside. Anna, Elvira, and Ottavio appear
    masked and are invited in by Leporello. In the ballroom, Giovanni dances with Zerlina, then tries to drag her into the adjoining room.
    When she cries for help, Giovanni blames Leporello. Anna, Elvira, and Ottavio take off their masks and, along with Zerlina and Masetto,
    accuse Giovanni, who is momentarily surprised but manages to slip away.
    ACT II
    Having exchanged clothes with Giovanni, Leporello takes Elvira on a nighttime walk, leaving his master free to serenade her maid.
    When Masetto arrives with a band of peasants to hunt down Giovanni, the disguised Don sends them off in various directions, then beats
    up Masetto. Zerlina finds her bruised fiancé and comforts him.
    Later that night, Leporello—still believed by Elvira to be Giovanni—is surprised by Anna, Ottavio, Zerlina, and Masetto, who all
    denounce the supposed Don. Fearing for his life, Leporello reveals his true identity before making his escape. Ottavio proclaims that
    he will take revenge on Giovanni and asks the others to look after Anna. Elvira thinks about Giovanni, whom she still loves in spite
    of everything.
    In a cemetery, Giovanni and Leporello meet the statue of the Commendatore, who warns Giovanni that by morning he will laugh no longer.
    Giovanni forces the terrified Leporello to invite the statue to dinner. The statue accepts.
    Once again, Ottavio asks Anna to marry him, but she replies that she will not until her father’s death has been avenged.
    Elvira arrives at Giovanni’s home. She makes a last desperate attempt to persuade him to change his life, but he only laughs at her.
    The figure of the Commendatore enters and asks Giovanni to repent. When he boldly refuses he is consumed by flames. Elvira, Anna,
    Ottavio, Zerlina, Masetto, and Leporello appear, contemplating their futures and the fate of an immoral man.`

    composer: "Richard Wagner",
    language: "German",
    year: 1876,
    summary: `On the rock of Brünnhilde the three Norns, daughters of the Goddess of Fate, weave fate, singing of the holy ash tree,
    from which a brave god made a spear, broken by a young hero and chopped into logs at the command of Wotan, to be piled around Valhalla,
    where they will burn the place and bring an end to the gods. As dawn breaks Siegfried emerges from the cave with Brünnhilde,
    having acquired from her her strength as a Valkyrie. As he prepares to leave, he gives her his ring, a symbol of his deeds,
    and she gives him Grane, her horse. The first act opens in the Gibichung throne-room, where Hagen urges his half-brother Gunther to marry Brünnhilde,
    although she is fated to be the wife of Siegfried the Volsung, who could, by trickery, be induced to marry their sister, Gutrune. Siegfried arrives
    and swears friendship with Hagen. Drugged by Gutrune, he offers her marriage and then agrees, using the Tarncap which will transform him,
    to bring Gunther the woman he wants, in exchange for Gutrune. They swear friendship and join together ritually as blood brothers.
    Siegfried and Gunther leave, in search of Brünnhilde, while Hagen guards the house, awaiting their return, with the ring.
    Waltraute brings Brünnhilde news of Wotan’s despair, in the absence of the ring, but she refuses to part with Siegfried’s pledge of love.
    Siegfried, in the form of Gunther, leaps through the surrounding flames to claim Brünnhilde as his wife, seizing the ring from her finger.
    At the hall of the Gibichungs Alberich reminds Hagen of Siegfried’s defeat of Wotan and of the power that the ring will give them.
    Siegfried returns to claim Gutrune and Hagen calls his men to attend the coming wedding. Gunther and Brünnhilde arrive and the latter,
    seeing the ring on Siegfried’s finger, realises that there has been trickery. She curses Siegfried and tells Hagen that the hero can be
    wounded only from the back, a death that can be arranged at a hunting-party. The Rhinemaidens ask Siegfried for the ring and as the hunters rest,
    Hagen gives Siegfried a drink that revives his memory, piercing his back with his spear and mortally wounding him. Siegfried’s body is brought back,
    to Gutrune’s distress. Gunther and Hagen fight and the former is killed, but the ring cannot be taken from Siegfried’s body.
    Brünnhilde orders a pyre to be raised. This is lit, and she rides into it on her horse, Grane, wearing the ring, which will return, on her death,
    to the Rhinemaidens, who drag Hagen down to the depths of the river. Now flames are seen as Valhalla, the home of the gods, finally burns.`

    name: "La bohème",
    composer: "Giacomo Puccini",
    language: "Italian",
    year: 1896,
    summary: `La Bohème is one of the three operas - the others are Carmen and Aida - believed to be the most popular ever written.
    In the case of La Bohème the reason is that it virtually defines the term 'romantic'. The poignant story of Mimì and Rodolfo is told in music
    of such tender beauty, allied, as always, to Puccini's intuition of what works in the theatre, resulting in an opera that readily appeals to our
    emotions and senses. 'Che gelida manina - Your tiny hand is frozen...' The moment when Mimì and Rodolfo meet and first touch is one of the very
    great moments of opera - created by the master hand of Giacomo Puccini, who unerringly trod the fine line between romance and sentimentality.
    Thomson Smillie outlines the background to the opera, explaining how painstakingly the composer worked to achieve this effect. An absorbing
    introduction both for those approaching La Bohème for the first time and for those wanting to know a bit more than just the big arias.`

    name: "Tosca",
    composer: "Giacomo Puccini",
    language: "Italian",
    year: 1900,
    summary: `Tosca is Puccini at the peak of his theatrical power. The story of the jealous, impassioned opera singer Floria Tosca and her doomed
    love for the painter Mario Cavaradossi is played out against backgrounds both historically and geographically overwhelming. It is set in three
    great and historical locations of Rome during the Napoleonic era. Spectacle, sensuality and cruelty battle for our attention in one of the most
    truly 'action-packed' works of theatre. Enticing us with just a couple of the 'great tunes' from this deeply affecting opera, David Timson then
    begins setting the biographical and operatic scene. The enduring popularity of Tosca is quickly understood - its appeal generated largely from
    exactly the same elements which once caused academics to brand it a 'shabby little shocker'. The master of melody is at his finest, as David Timson
    illustrates with characteristic enthusiasm.`

    name: "Elektra",
    composer: "Richard Strauss",
    language: "German",
    year: 1909,
    summary: `The Greek general Agamemnon has returned from the capture of Troy to be murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus,
    who now reign in his stead. Electra, barely tolerated in the palace, mourns her dead father, dreaming of revenge. Her younger sister Chrysothemis
    warns her that Clytemnestra plans to have her imprisoned. Clytemnestra now seeks from Electra some release from her torments, suggesting sacrifice.
    Electra agrees, and outlines the pursuit of her father’s murderers by her brother Orestes. Clytemnestra is relieved when a messenger brings news of
    the death of Orestes. Electra now tries to persuade Chrysothemis to join her in vengeance, but with no success. She digs in the ground for the axe
    she needs, to be found by Orestes, returned. He seeks out Clytemnestra and kills her. Electra is left to welcome the returning Aegisthus, dancing
    round him. He goes into the palace and is struck down. Electra dances wildly in triumph, before falling down dead, leaving Chrysothemis beating at
    the palace doors and calling the name of her brother.

    Strauss’s opera is an immensely powerful work. Various motifs reappear in the musical texture, which opens with the chanting of the name Agamemnon.
    Electra herself remains on stage throughout and the opera deals with a series of confrontations, with her sister, with Clytemnestra, with her brother,
    leading to the climax of the recognition scene, and finally with Aegisthus, before her wild dance and her death in triumph.`

    language: "Italian",
    year: 1853,
    summary: `ACT I
    Violetta Valéry knows that she will die soon, exhausted by her restless life as a courtesan. At a party she is introduced to Alfredo Germont,
    who has been fascinated by her for a long time. Rumor has it that he has been enquiring after her health every day. The guests are amused by
    this seemingly naïve and emotional attitude, and they ask Alfredo to propose a toast. He celebrates true love, and Violetta responds in praise
    of free love (Ensemble: “Libiamo ne’ lieti calici”). She is touched by his candid manner and honesty. Suddenly she feels faint, and the guests
    withdraw. Only Alfredo remains behind and declares his love (Duet: “Un dì felice”). There is no place for such feelings in her life, Violetta
    replies. But she gives him a camellia, asking him to return when the flower has faded. He realizes this means he will see her again the following
    day. Alone, Violetta is torn by conflicting emotions—she doesn’t want to give up her way of life, but at the same time she feels that Alfredo has
    awakened her desire to be truly loved (“Ah, fors’è lui… Sempre libera”).
    ACT II
    Violetta has chosen a life with Alfredo, and they enjoy their love in the country, far from society (“De’ miei bollenti spiriti”). When Alfredo
    discovers that this is only possible because Violetta has been selling her property, he immediately leaves for Paris to procure money. Violetta
    has received an invitation to a masked ball, but she no longer cares for such distractions. In Alfredo’s absence, his father, Giorgio Germont,
    pays her a visit. He demands that she separate from his son, as their relationship threatens his daughter’s impending marriage (Duet: “Pura siccome
      un angelo”). But over the course of their conversation, Germont comes to realize that Violetta is not after his son’s money—she is a woman who
      loves unselfishly. He appeals to Violetta’s generosity of spirit and explains that, from a bourgeois point of view, her liaison with Alfredo
      has no future. Violetta’s resistance dwindles and she finally agrees to leave Alfredo forever. Only after her death shall he learn the truth
      about why she returned to her old life. She accepts the invitation to the ball and writes a goodbye letter to her lover. Alfredo returns, and
      while he is reading the letter, his father appears to console him (“Di Provenza”). But all the memories of home and a happy family can’t prevent
      the furious and jealous Alfredo from seeking revenge for Violetta’s apparent betrayal.
    At the masked ball, news has spread of Violetta and Alfredo’s separation. There are grotesque dance entertainments, ridiculing the duped lover.
    Meanwhile, Violetta and her new lover, Baron Douphol, have arrived. Alfredo and the baron battle at the gaming table and Alfredo wins a fortune:
    lucky at cards, unlucky in love. When everybody has withdrawn, Alfredo confronts Violetta, who claims to be truly in love with the Baron. In his
    rage Alfredo calls the guests as witnesses and declares that he doesn’t owe Violetta anything. He throws his winnings at her. Giorgio Germont, who
    has witnessed the scene, rebukes his son for his behavior. The baron challenges his rival to a duel.
    ACT III
    Violetta is dying. Her last remaining friend, Doctor Grenvil, knows that she has only a few more hours to live. Alfredo’s father has written to
    Violetta, informing her that his son was not injured in the duel. Full of remorse, he has told him about Violetta’s sacrifice. Alfredo wants to
    rejoin her as soon as possible. Violetta is afraid that he might be too late (“Addio, del passato”). The sound of rampant celebrations are heard
    from outside while Violetta is in mortal agony. But Alfredo does arrive and the reunion fills Violetta with a final euphoria (Duet: “Parigi, o
      cara”). Her energy and exuberant joy of life return. All sorrow and suffering seems to have left her—a final illusion, before death claims her.`

    year: 1851,
    summary: `Rigoletto is happy to abet the Duke in his amorous exploits and his bitter tongue earns him the hatred of the courtiers, of Count
    Ceprano, openly cuckolded by the Duke and of Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke has dishonoured. Monterone vents his anger at the Duke
    and curses Rigoletto. Meanwhile the courtiers suspect that Rigoletto himself has a mistress and plot their revenge. The bravo Sparafucile offers
    his services to Rigoletto, should he require them, and Rigoletto sees a similarity between their functions, before he goes into his house, where
    he warns his daughter Gilda, recently returned from her convent schooling, to be careful not to leave the house. Gilda, however, has been wooed
    by one she believes to be a young student, whom she has seen in church. This is, in fact, the Duke. The courtiers take their revenge on Rigoletto
    by abducting Gilda and taking her to the Duke, assisted by a blindfold Rigoletto, who thinks he is helping the abduction of Countess Ceprano. At
    court again, he turns on those who have tricked him, and plans his own revenge on the Duke through the agency of Sparafucile. Rigoletto then seeks
    to disillusion Gilda, who still loves the Duke, by showing her the latter’s depravity. He takes her to witness an assignation with Maddalena,
    Sparafucile’s sister, having arranged that Sparafucile will murder the Duke. Maddalena, however, pleads for the life of the young man (the Duke
      disguised as a soldier), and Sparafucile agrees that if any other man should come before midnight, he will kill him in place of the Duke, and
      give Rigoletto the body in a sack, as agreed. Gilda determines to sacrifice herself for the Duke, and, dressed as a man as she is, enters the
      room and is murdered. Her body, in a sack, is delivered to Rigoletto outside, but his delight is destroyed when he hears the voice of the Duke
      inside the house, and opens the sack to reveal the body of his daughter.`

    whom he makes drunk. A fight breaks out with Roderigo, in which Montano becomes involved. Othello is summoned by the general alarm and dismisses Cassio
    from his service. Othello and Desdemona sing of their love, as he takes her back again into their chamber. In the second act Iago persuades Cassio to
    seek reinstatement through Desdemona and kindles and feeds Othello’s jealousy, producing as final proof of her infidelity his report of what Cassio
    has said in his sleep and the handkerchief that she has dropped and that has been taken from Emilia by Iago. In the third act Desdemona unwittingly
    fuels Othello’s anger and jealousy by continuing to plead for Cassio. Ambassadors from Venice recall Othello, with Cassio to be left in his place.
    Othello treats Desdemona cruelly, before the company, and Iago continues to play on his jealousy, the handkerchief now planted in Cassio’s lodging.
    The last act is set in Desdemona’s bedroom, where she seeks some comfort from Emilia. Woken from sleep by Othello, she again pleads her innocence,
    as he suffocates her. She can still murmur words to Emilia, when the latter brings news of Cassio’s killing of Roderigo, seeking to excuse Othello.
    Lodovico gives a report of Roderigo’s dying confession and Emilia tells of the handkerchief, convincing Othello of his tragic mistake. Seizing his

    language: "Italian",
    year: 1786,
    summary: `Figaro and Susanna are to marry, but the Count has given them rooms near to his own, which will be convenient if he needs access to Susanna.
    Bartolo wants to take revenge on Figaro, who had helped the Count to marry his ward Rosina, now the Countess. His housekeeper Marcellina has lent money
    to Figaro, who has promised to marry her, if he cannot repay it. Cherubino tells Susanna that he loves all women, and Susanna hides him, as the Count is
    heard approaching. His proposals to Susanna are interrupted by the sound of Don Basilio coming near, and he too hides behind the chair, allowing Cherubino
    to hide himself sitting on it, under a dress thrown over him by Susanna. Basilio now refers to Cherubino’s love for the Countess, and the Count emerges to
    find out more. Susanna tries to distract them by fainting, but Cherubino is discovered. Figaro brings in a group of peasants, singing praise of the Count,
    who has surrendered, it is suggested, his droit de seigneur as far as Susanna is concerned, but the Count delays their marriage and packs Cherubino off to
    the army. Figaro, however, detains Cherubino, since he has plans for him. In the second act the Countess, in her room, is sad, neglected by her husband.
    She listens to Figaro’s plan to dress Cherubino as a girl and put him in Susanna’s place in an attempt to trap the Count. Cherubino is singing of his love
    for the Countess, when the Count returns from hunting, eager to pursue matters divulged to him in an anonymous letter accusing the Countess. Cherubino hides
    in the closet and Susanna, unseen by the others, comes in. The Countess tells her husband that Susanna is in the closet but the door cannot be opened.
    The Count, suspicious, goes to fetch tools to open the door, taking the Countess with him. This allows Cherubino to jump out of the window and Susanna to
    take his place. The Count returns and the closet is opened, revealing Susanna. Antonio, the gardener, adds complications when he comes in to complain of
    someone jumping out of the window, and Figaro now claims that it was him. The act ends with the appearance of Don Basilio, Bartolo and Marcellina, seeking
    justice. As the wedding is prepared, in the third act, Susanna, at the suggestion of the Countess, agrees to an assignation with the Count. Marcellina’s
    complaint against Figaro is heard and he claims that he needs parental consent for his marriage to her, if it is to take place. It then transpires that
    Marcellina is in fact his mother and Bartolo his father. In the fourth act, in the garden at night, Figaro is given cause for jealousy of Susanna, but
    she is now disguised as the Countess and the Countess as Susanna. The Count unknowingly woos his own wife, while Figaro deliberately provokes his jealousy
    by his own approaches to the supposed Countess, in fact Susanna. The opera ends with the Count humbled but penitent, reconciled now with his wife, Figaro
    with Susanna, Cherubino with Barbarina, and Marcellina with Bartolo.`

    summary: `A mythical land between the sun and the moon. Three ladies in the service of the Queen of the Night save Prince Tamino from a serpent. When they leave to tell the queen, the birdcatcher Papageno appears. He boasts to Tamino that it was he who killed the creature. The ladies return to give Tamino a portrait of the queen’s daughter, Pamina, who they say has been enslaved by the evil Sarastro. Tamino immediately falls in love with the girl’s picture. The queen, appearing in a burst of thunder, tells Tamino about the loss of her daughter and commands him to rescue her. The ladies give a magic flute to Tamino and silver bells to Papageno to ensure their safety on the journey and appoint three spirits to guide them.
    Sarastro’s slave Monostatos pursues Pamina but is frightened away by Papageno. The birdcatcher tells Pamina that Tamino loves her and is on his way to save her. Led by the three spirits to the temple of Sarastro, Tamino learns from a high priest that it is the Queen, not Sarastro, who is evil. Hearing that Pamina is safe, Tamino charms the wild animals with his flute, then rushes off to follow the sound of Papageno’s pipes. Monostatos and his men chase Papageno and Pamina but are left helpless when Papageno plays his magic bells. Sarastro enters in great ceremony. He punishes Monostatos and promises Pamina that he will eventually set her free. Pamina catches a glimpse of Tamino, who is led into the temple with Papageno.
    Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino will undergo initiation rites. Monostatos tries to kiss the sleeping Pamina but is surprised by the appearance of the Queen of the Night. The Queen gives her daughter a dagger and orders her to murder Sarastro.
    Sarastro finds the desperate Pamina and consoles her, explaining that he is not interested in vengeance. Tamino and Papageno are told by a priest that they must remain silent and are not allowed to eat, a vow that Papageno immediately breaks when he takes a glass of water from a flirtatious old lady. When he asks her name, the old lady vanishes. The three spirits appear to guide Tamino through the rest of his journey and to tell Papageno to be quiet. Tamino remains silent even when Pamina appears. Misunderstanding his vow for coldness, she is heartbroken.
    The priests inform Tamino that he has only two more trials to complete his initiation. Papageno, who has given up on entering the brotherhood, longs for a wife instead. He eventually settles for the old lady. When he promises to be faithful she turns into a beautiful young Papagena but immediately disappears.
    Pamina and Tamino are reunited and face the ordeals of water and fire together, protected by the magic flute.
    Papageno tries to hang himself on a tree but is saved by the three spirits, who remind him that if he uses his magic bells he will find true happiness. When he plays the bells, Papagena appears and the two start making family plans. The Queen of the Night, her three ladies, and Monostatos attack the temple but are defeated and banished. Sarastro blesses Pamina and Tamino as all join in hailing the triumph of courage, virtue, and wisdom.`

    summary: "Madama Butterfly runs the gamut of operatic emotions. The title heroine has a fragility wonderfully expressed in her entry music, deep sexual instincts as shown in the love duet, and immense tragic stature in her last hours. The fate of Madama Butterfly - married to an American sailor and then abandoned - engages our emotions, as it obviously did Puccini's to a degree equalled by few other opera heroines. The oriental setting and the exquisite orchestral and choral writings are treasured bonuses. This audiobook is the perfect introduction to Madama Butterfly. We learn about the background to Puccini's 'Japanese' opera, the social themes of honour and loyalty it involves, and how it progressed from a surprisingly unsuccessful premiere to one of the central and best-loved works of the international operatic repertory. As the story unfolds, we get to know the melodies which make this such a moving and compelling opera."

    summary: `ACT I
    Vienna, during the last years of the Habsburg Empire. The Marschallin, Princess von Werdenberg, has spent the night with her young lover, Octavian, Count Rofrano. He hides when a page brings breakfast, then again when loud voices are heard in the antechamber. The unexpected visitor is the Marschallin’s country cousin, Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau. Bursting into the room, he brags about his amorous conquests and his upcoming marriage to Sophie von Faninal, the young daughter of a wealthy bourgeois. When he asks the Marschallin for advice as to which cavalier could present Sophie with the traditional silver engagement rose, she suggests Octavian—who suddenly, to avoid discovery, emerges from his hiding place disguised as a chambermaid. The baron instantly starts to make advances towards “Mariandel,” who quickly makes her escape as the room fills with the daily crowd of petitioners and salespeople. Among them is a singer, whose aria is cut short by Ochs’s wrangling with a lawyer over Sophie’s dowry. The Baron hires a pair of Italian intriguers, Annina and Valzacchi, to locate the shy servant girl.
    When the room is cleared, the Marschallin, appalled by the thought of the rude Ochs marrying the innocent young girl, muses on her own waning youth. The returning Octavian is surprised to find her in a distant and melancholy mood. He passionately declares his love but she can only think about the passing of time and tells him that one day he will leave her for a younger woman. Hurt, he rushes off. The Marschallin tries to call him back, but it is too late. She summons her page and sends Octavian the silver rose.
    ACT II
    On the morning of her engagement, Sophie excitedly awaits the arrival of the cavalier of the rose. Octavian enters and presents her with the silver rose on behalf of the Baron. Sophie accepts, enraptured, and the two young people feel an instant attraction to each other. When Ochs, whom Sophie has never met, arrives, the girl is shocked by his crude manners. Ochs goes off to discuss the wedding contract with Faninal, and Sophie asks Octavian for help. They end up embracing and are surprised by Annina and Valzacchi, who summon Ochs. The outraged Octavian grazes the Baron’s arm with his rapier and Ochs melodramatically calls for a doctor. In the ensuing confusion, Sophie tells her father that she will not marry the Baron, while Octavian enlists Annina and Valzacchi to participate in an intrigue he is hatching. When Ochs is alone, nursing his wound with a glass of wine, Annina, sent by Octavian, appears with a letter from “Mariandel,” asking Ochs to a rendezvous. Intoxicated with his own charm, the Baron is delighted at the prospect of a tête-à-tête. When he refuses to tip Annina, she determines to get even.
    ACT III
    At Octavian’s instigation, Annina and Valzacchi prepare the back room of a dingy inn for Ochs’s rendezvous. Before long, the Baron and “Mariandel” arrive for a private supper. As she coyly leads him on, grotesque apparitions pop out of windows and secret panels, terrifying the Baron. Annina, disguised as a widow, runs in crying that Ochs is the father of her many children. When the police appear, Ochs claims that “Mariandel” is his fiancée. The arriving Faninal, furious at his future son-in-law’s behavior, summons Sophie to set matters straight, then faints and is carried off. At the height of the confusion, the Marschallin enters. Octavian takes off his disguise and the Marschallin explains to Ochs that it was all a farce. He finally admits defeat and leaves, pursued by the innkeeper and various other people who all demand payment of their bills. Left alone with Octavian and Sophie, the Marschallin laments that she must lose her lover so soon, but nevertheless accepts the truth. She gives the bewildered Octavian to Sophie and quietly leaves the room. The young lovers realize that their dream has come true.`

    name: "Ariadne auf Naxos",
    composer: "Richard Strauss",
    language: "German",
    year: 1915,
    summary: `PROLOGUE

    Musicians, singers, actors, carpenters, and stage
    hands are preparing for the first performance of a
    serious opera which has been specially
    commissioned by the owner of the house to
    entertain his guests.
    There is consternation when the Major-domo
    announces that, after the opera, there will be a
    Harlequinade entertainment; moreover the two
    shows must not overrun their allotted span of
    time,as the fireworks will begin precisely at nine o
    clock! Worse is to come, as a little later the
    Major-domo returns to inform the two troupes that
    his master has changed his mind: now both
    entertainments will be played simultaneously, the
    serious opera being punctuated by intervals of
    dancing from the comedians.
    The composer of the serious opera
    extemporizes an aria which he intends for the
    tenor and languishes at the idea of his
    masterpiece being combined with a common
    dancing show. He tries to explain to Zerbinetta
    that Ariadne prefers death to the embraces of any
    man other that her beloved, and proving
    unsuccessful in this, he indulges in a duet with
    Zerbinetta in which he comes perilously close to
    declaring that he loves her. There is some trouble
    with both tenor and prima donna, after which the
    composer declares his conviction in the power of
    music, the most sacred of the arts.



    THE OPERA

    After an interval, the curtain rises on the opera
    itself, watched from boxes by the owner of the
    house and his guests. The setting, which is seen
    only from its reversed side in the Prologue, is now
    seen from the front. At one side is a cave in whose
    entrance Ariadne can be seen asleep, watched by
    Naiad, Dryad and Echo. These creatures express
    a certain sympathy with Ariadne's sorrow, to
    which, however, they have become accustomed
    with the passage of time.
    Ariadne speaks as if in a dream. She takes no
    notice when the Harlequinade quartet and
    Zerbinetta comment on her distress and try to
    think of a means to comfort her. Ariadne
    welcomes the idea of death. Not even a
    determined effort by Harlequin to cure her of her
    madness - for he thinks it must surely be that
    which is wrong with her - can stop her for long.
    Ariadne continues and, at mention of death's
    messenger, Hermes, she becomes more urgent.



    The four comedians make another attempt to
    cheer up the melancholy Ariadne, but their
    dancing and singing have not the slightest effect,
    even when they are joined by the sprightly
    Zerbinetta. Eventually, Zerbinetta bids them leave
    her to see what she can do on her own.
    Zerbinetta appeals to Ariadne, woman to
    woman. Ariadne is not the first to be abandoned
    by her lover, and will not be the last. Zerbinetta
    expounds her own fickle philosophy, and is quite
    unconcerned when Ariadne disappears inside her
    cave. Zerbinetta goes into details of her amorous
    career: she is pursued by the four comedians,
    each of whom seems amorously inclined.
    Zerbinetta encourages and eludes them all, until
    only Scaramuccio, Brighella, and Truffaldino are
    left. Much to their annoyance, Zerbinetta is
    immediately heard conversing tenderly with the
    Harlequin, whom they had thought safely out of
    the way. They rush to see what they can do about
    it.
    No sooner are they gone than the three
    attendant nymphs return to the stage, full of the
    sight they have just seen. A youthful god is
    coming, Bacchus, fresh from the embraces of
    Circe, but eager for a new adventure. They call to
    Ariadne, who emerges from the cave in time to
    hear Bacchus calling for Circe. The nymphs beg
    him to continue singing, and Ariadne hails him as
    the longed for messenger of death. In the arms of
    Bacchus, Ariadne finds consolation and
    Zerbinetta pops in to comment that all has turned
    out exactly as she would have expected.`
